                    <p>Hey, Bethany family! If you've ever had a hard time sleeping because you're stressed about money or felt overwhelmed with credit card bills you just can't pay off‚Äîyou're normal. Most people have car payments and credit cards, and most people feel lost, with no plan for the future.</p>
                    <p>But you CAN be different!</p>
                    <p>üöó You can rest knowing you've got enough for your family, both now and in the future.</p>
                    <p>üí∞ You can have money in the bank without debt hanging over your head.</p>
                    <p>üíë You can finally get on the same page about money with your spouse.</p>
                    <p>üò¥ You can sleep soundly every night.</p>
